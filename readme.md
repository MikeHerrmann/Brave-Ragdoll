## Brave Ragdoll ##
Animated character will switch into a ragdoll when hit by the ball (shoot: space bar).
The ragdoll motion is observed and when it comes to rest it will be switched back to animation.  
Depending on its position (lying on the front or back) the corresponding animation will be played.  
The challenge is to position the animated character as close as possible to the ragdoll rest position and bridge the difference by a lerped motion.
